this is a shitty program i wrote when i was half asleep :) 
you can use it to download books from the archive.org emergency library 
You must first borrow the book for this program to work then you can run this program and return it if u fancy 
also be sure to download the chromedriver for chrome (if you want me to add intergration for other browsers then tell me somehow)
